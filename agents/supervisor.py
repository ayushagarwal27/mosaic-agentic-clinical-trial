async def supervisor_route(state: MosaicState) -> dict:

    The entry point of every MOSAIC analysis run.

    WHAT THIS FUNCTION DOES:
    1. Generates a unique run ID for this analysis session
    2. Logs what task is being investigated
    3. Returns an updated state that all specialists will receive

    WHY SO SIMPLE?
    The supervisor does NOT need to read the task and decide which
    specialists to activate — we always run ALL six specialists in
    parallel for every task. This is by design:
    - Different agents may find different signals in the same task
    - Running all six costs the same time as running one (parallel)
    - We never miss a signal type by selectively routing

    LANGGRAPH NODE CONTRACT:
    Every LangGraph node must:
    - Accept: the current MosaicState
    - Return: a dict of ONLY the fields that changed
    LangGraph automatically merges the returned dict into the full state.
    You do not return the entire state — just your changes.

    Args:
        state: The current MosaicState from LangGraph.

    Returns:
        Dict with updated run_id, agents_activated, and signals fields.

    Reads all agent signals and compiles the final intelligence brief.

    WHEN THIS RUNS:
    LangGraph calls this node only after ALL six specialist nodes
    have completed. This is guaranteed by the graph structure in
    graph_builder.py — all specialists connect to this node.

    WHAT THIS FUNCTION DOES:
    1. Collects all signals from state (from all 6 agents)
    2. Separates high-confidence signals from those needing review
    3. Uses GPT-4o to write a professional intelligence brief
    4. Returns the completed state

    WHY USE GPT-4o TO WRITE THE BRIEF?
    The raw signals are structured data — JSON with fields like
    summary, confidence, nct_id. They are accurate but not readable.
    GPT-4o transforms them into a professional narrative brief that
    a human analyst can read and act on immediately.
