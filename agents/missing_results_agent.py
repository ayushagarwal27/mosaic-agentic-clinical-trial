                    Find completed clinical trials that have never posted their results
                    to ClinicalTrials.gov, violating federal law (FDAAA 801).

                    1. Search past episodes to see if you have investigated similar cases

                    3. For each suspicious study, verify the current status with a live API call
                    4. Check the sponsor's track record using get_sponsor_profile
                    5. Generate a signal with confidence score based on evidence strength
                    6. Update the sponsor profile with your findings
                    7. Save this session as an episode before finishing

                    CONFIDENCE SCORING GUIDE:

                    - 0.8  : Completed 2-5 years ago, zero results, known non-compliant sponsor

                    - 0.6  : Completed 1 year ago exactly, borderline timing
                    - Below 0.6: Uncertain — send to human review
