    """
    Fetch all published research papers that reference a specific
    clinical trial — LIVE from PubMed right now.

    This is the primary tool for the Side Effect Checker agent.
    It finds papers where authors reported their findings about
    a specific trial — then the agent compares those findings
    against what the official trial filing says.

    WHY THIS IS POWERFUL:
    Official filings are written by the sponsor.
    Published papers are written by independent researchers.
    When these two sources DISAGREE about safety or outcomes,
    that disagreement is a signal worth investigating.

    Example scenario:
    Official filing says: "No serious adverse events observed"
    Published paper says: "Three patients were hospitalised"
    → Side Effect Checker flags this as a safety gap signal.

    Args:
        nct_id:     The trial's NCT ID to search for in PubMed.
                    Example: "NCT04788680"
        max_papers: Maximum papers to fetch. Default 10.
                    Keep low — each paper adds to agent context window.
                    More than 15 papers can overwhelm the agent.

    Returns:
        JSON string with all papers found, including:
        - title, abstract, journal, authors, publication date
        - word_count (very short abstracts may indicate limited detail)
        Empty list if no papers reference this trial in PubMed.

    Fetch papers for a trial and compare them against the official filing.

    This is the Side Effect Checker's most powerful tool.
    It fetches all published papers about a trial, then returns
    both the official filing summary AND the papers — so the agent
    can compare them and identify discrepancies.

    The agent looks for:
    - Safety events mentioned in papers but not in the filing
    - Different severity levels (filing says "mild", paper says "serious")
    - Outcomes reported in papers that differ from the primary outcome
    - Results published in papers when no official results were posted
