    Runs an async coroutine synchronously.

    WHAT IS A COROUTINE?
    When you call an async function WITHOUT await, Python gives you
    back a "coroutine" — a suspended function that has not run yet.
    Example:
      result = store.search(...)      → coroutine (not run yet)
      result = await store.search(...)→ actual result (ran and waited)

    This helper takes that suspended coroutine and runs it to completion
    using the event loop — giving us the actual result synchronously.

    Args:
        coroutine: An unawaited async function call.

    Returns:
        Whatever the async function would have returned with await.
