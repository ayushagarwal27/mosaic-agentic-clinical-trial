"""
Sponsor knowledge base for MOSAIC agents.

Semantic memory holds accumulated FACTS about the world — in this
case, a credibility profile for every research sponsor MOSAIC has
ever encountered. Every time MOSAIC analyses a study, it updates the
relevant sponsor's profile: posting results on time raises
credibility, missing results lowers it, outcome switching increases
the broken-promises count, and silent delays raise the average delay.
Over time this builds a data-driven picture of each sponsor's
behaviour, rather than one based on reputation.
