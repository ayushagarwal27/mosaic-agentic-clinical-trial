        Instead of opening the database connection the moment

        tries to use it. This is called "lazy initialisation."

        WHY DO WE DO THIS?
        When MOSAIC starts up, it imports many classes including
        EpisodicStore. If we opened the database connection in
        __init__, every import would immediately try to connect
        to Cloud SQL — even if that class is never actually used
        in that run. Lazy initialisation avoids wasted connections.

        Registers the custom pgvector VECTOR codec on a connection.

        WHAT IS A CODEC?
        A codec is a pair of functions:
          ENCODER: converts Python data → database format
          DECODER: converts database format → Python data

        WHY DO WE NEED A CUSTOM CODEC FOR VECTOR?
        PostgreSQL knows about the VECTOR type (added by pgvector).
        But asyncpg is a generic driver — it only knows about
        standard PostgreSQL types like TEXT, INTEGER, FLOAT etc.
        It has NO idea what to do with VECTOR.

        Without registering this codec:
          - Writing: asyncpg cannot convert our Python list of
            floats into the format pgvector expects → error
          - Reading: asyncpg cannot convert the VECTOR value it
            gets back from the database into a Python list → error

        With this codec registered:
          - Writing: [0.023, -0.041, 0.891] → "[0.023,-0.041,0.891]"
          - Reading: "[0.023,-0.041,0.891]" → [0.023, -0.041, 0.891]

        asyncpg calls this function automatically on every new
        connection it creates, via the init= parameter above.

        Args:
            conn: One fresh database connection from the pool.
                  asyncpg passes this automatically.

        Converts any text string into a 1536-number vector embedding.

        WHAT IS AN EMBEDDING — ONE MORE TIME SIMPLY:
        An embedding is a position on a giant meaning map.
        Similar texts end up close together on that map.
        "Results never posted" and "outcomes not published" would
        be very close together even though the words are different.

        We use this method in TWO places:
        1. When SAVING an episode — embed the content so it can
           be found by semantic search later.
        2. When SEARCHING episodes — embed the query so we can
           compare it against stored episode embeddings.

        from different models cannot be compared meaningfully.
