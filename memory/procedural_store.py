"""
Procedural memory store for MOSAIC agents.

Procedural memory encodes HOW an agent should reason, as opposed to
episodic memory, which encodes WHAT happened in past sessions. Each
agent starts with a set of DEFAULT reasoning rules. When a human
reviewer rejects a signal and explains why, that rejection reason is
written into the agent's procedures table as a new LEARNED rule,
permanently changing how the agent reasons going forward.
