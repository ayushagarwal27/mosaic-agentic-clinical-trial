# PURPOSE:
#   Handles POST /api/v1/analyze — the most important endpoint.
#   This is the endpoint that triggers a full MOSAIC analysis run.

# WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THIS ENDPOINT IS CALLED:
#   1. Receives the analysis task and parameters
#   2. Invokes the compiled LangGraph graph with the task
#   3. The graph runs all 6 specialist agents in parallel
#   4. Signals are processed through the HITL gate
#   5. Supervisor compiles the final intelligence brief
#   6. Returns the complete analysis result to the caller

# THIS IS THE ENTRY POINT FOR EVERYTHING:
#   All the infrastructure we built — ingestion, processing,
#   memory, agents, tools — is exercised by this one endpoint.
